    "## Part 2: Configure and train the Noise2Void Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise2Void comes with a special config-object, where we store network-architecture and training specific parameters. See the docstring of the <code>N2VConfig</code> constructor for a description of all parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the config-object, we provide the training data <code>X</code>. From <code>X</code> we extract <code>mean</code> and <code>std</code> that will be used to normalize all data before it is processed by the network. We also extract the dimensionality and number of channels from <code>X</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to supervised training (i.e. traditional CARE), we recommend to use N2V with an increased <code>train_batch_size</code> and <code>batch_norm</code>.\n",
    "To keep the network from learning the identity we have to manipulate the input pixels during training. For this we have the parameter <code>n2v_manipulator</code> with default value <code>'uniform_withCP'</code>. Most pixel manipulators will compute the replacement value based on a neighborhood. With <code>n2v_neighborhood_radius</code> we can control its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other pixel manipulators:\n",
    "* normal_withoutCP: samples the neighborhood according to a normal gaussian distribution, but without the center pixel\n",
    "* normal_additive: adds a random number to the original pixel value. The random number is sampled from a gaussian distribution with zero-mean and sigma = <code>n2v_neighborhood_radius</code>\n",
    "* normal_fitted: uses a random value from a gaussian normal distribution with mean equal to the mean of the neighborhood and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the neighborhood.\n",
    "* identity: performs no pixel manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For faster training multiple pixels per input patch can be manipulated. In our experiments we manipulated about 0.198% of the input pixels per patch. For a patch size of 64 by 64 pixels this corresponds to about 8 pixels. This fraction can be tuned via <code>n2v_perc_pix</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Noise2Void training it is possible to pass arbitrarily large patches to the training method. From these patches random subpatches of size <code>n2v_patch_shape</code> are extracted during training. Default patch shape is set to (64, 64).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past we experienced bleedthrough artifacts between channels if training was terminated to early. To counter bleedthrough we added the `single_net_per_channel` option, which is turned on by default. In the back a single U-Net for each channel is created and trained independently, thereby removing the possiblity of bleedthrough. <br/>\n",
    "Essentially the network gets multiplied by the number of channels, which increases the memory requirements. If your GPU gets too small, you can always split the channels manually and train a network for each channel one after another.\n",
