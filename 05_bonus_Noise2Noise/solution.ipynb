    "# Noise2Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "CARE networks like the one you trained in the first restoration exercise require that you acquire pairs\n",
    "of high and low SNR. However, this often not possible. One such case is when it is simply\n",
    "not possible to acquire high SNR images.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do when you are stuck with just noisy images? We also have seen Noise2Void, which\n",
    "is a self-supervised method that can be trained on noisy images. But there are other \n",
    "supervised approaches that can be trained on noisy images only, such as Noise2Noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noise2Noise follows the same training method as CARE, except that instead of predicting clean images the UNet is trained to predict noisy images.\n",
    "The training data is obtained by imaging a sample twice, obtaining two images with the same underlying signal but different samples of noise.\n",
    "The noise in each image will be statistically independent of the noise in the other, meaning that seeing one image tells us nothing about the noise content of the other image.\n",
    "Therefore, a UNet that tries to guess one noisy image from another will be able to accurately predict the signal content, which is identical, but will be completely unable to predict the noise content.\n",
    "Nonetheless, it will try to make its best guess of the noise content - one that minimises the mean square error loss.\n",
    "Luckily for us, noise content is on average zero, meaning that the best best guess is zero-valued noise, i.e., no noise.\n",
    "This means that the network will converge to the same solution as it would if it were trained with clean targets, although it will require more data to compensate for the reduced signal content of the targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will again use the [Careamics](https://careamics.github.io) library.\n",
