    "# Noise2Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "CARE networks like the one you trained in the first image restoration exercise require that you acquire pairs\n",
    "of high and low signal-to-noise ratio images. However, this often extremely challenging or, even, not possible. One such case is when it is simply\n",
    "not possible to acquire high SNR images as the sample is too much susceptible to illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do when you are stuck with just noisy images? We have already seen Noise2Void, which\n",
    "is a self-supervised method that can be trained on noisy images. But there are other \n",
    "supervised approaches that can be trained on noisy images only, such as Noise2Noise. \n",
    "Noise2Noise (N2N) is very similar to CARE, except instead of using noisy inputs and clean targets, N2N uses noisy inputs and noisy targets.\n",
    "This paired data would be aquired by taking two images of your sample in quick succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise2Noise relies on 2 assumptions: \n",
    "1. The noise in one image is statistically independent of the noise in any other image.\n",
    "That is, knowing the value of the random noise in one image tells you nothing about the random noise in another other image.\n",
    "2. The noise is on average zero. Meaning that, while noise can randomly increase or decrease the intensity of a pixel, the average change will be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions are widely met by imaging noise.\n",
    "Therefore, if we train a neural network to predict one noisy image from another using the mean squared error loss function, the network will learn to predict a denoised image.\n",
    "Theoretically, we can achieve the exact same result as CARE without any clean images!\n",
    "However, in practice, N2N will require more training data than CARE to make up for the noisier training signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will again use the [Careamics](https://careamics.github.io) library.\n",
