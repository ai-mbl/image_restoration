    "Fluorescence microscopy is constrained by the microscope's optics, fluorophore chemistry, and the sample's photon tolerance. These constraints require balancing imaging speed, resolution, light exposure, and depth. CARE demonstrates how Deep Learning can extend the range of biological phenomena observable by microscopy when any of these factor becomes limiting.\n",

    "In this first exercise we will train a CARE model for a 2D denoising task. CARE stands for Content-Aware image REstoration, and is a supervised method in which we use pairs of degraded and high quality images to train a particular task. The original paper demonstrated improvement of image quality on a variety of tasks such as image restoration or resolution improvement. Here, we will apply CARE to denoise images acquired at low laser power in order to recover the biological structures present in the data!\n",

    "[02_Noise2Void](../02_Noise2Void/exercise.ipynb) is a denoiser that is trained using unpaired noisy images, meaning that, unlike CARE, we don't need any examples of clean images.\n",
    "It's also relatively quick to train, but there's a catch.\n",
    "It relies on the assumption that the noise is unstructured.\n",
    "Unstructured noise is uncorrelated over pixels, so has no streaky or line artifacts.\n",
    "An example is shown below.\n",

    "[03_COSDD](../03_COSDD/exercise.ipynb) is also a denoiser trained using unpaired noisy images, but it can handle a specific form of structure.\n",
    "That structure is row correlation.\n",
    "Row-correlated noise is common in scanning-based imaging techniques like point-scanning confocal microscopy, an example is shown below.\n",
    "It can also be found when using sCMOS sensors.\n",
    "The practical trade-off with N2V is that COSDD takes much longer to train.\n",

    "It uses deep learning to separate multiple superimposed cellular structures within a single fluorescent image channel, turning one fluorescent channel into as many as four.\n",
    "Imaging multiple cellular structures in a single fluorescent channel effectively increases the available photon budget, which can be reallocated to achieve faster imaging, higher signal-to-noise ratios, or the imaging of additional structures. \n",
