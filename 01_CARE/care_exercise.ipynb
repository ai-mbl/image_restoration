CARE stands for Content-Aware image REstoration, and is a supervised method in which we use pairs of degraded and high quality image to train a particular task. The original paper demonstrated improvement of image quality on a variety of tasks such as image restoration or resolution improvement.

    "Here, we will be using high SNR images of Human U2OS cells taken from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection ([BBBC006v1](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC006)). The low SNR images were created by synthetically adding strong read-out and shot noise, and applying pixel binning of 2x2, thus mimicking acquisitions at a very low light level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the image pairs were synthetically created in this example, they are already aligned perfectly. Note that when working with real paired acquisitions, the low and high SNR images are not pixel-perfect aligned so they would often need to be co-registered before training a CARE model."
