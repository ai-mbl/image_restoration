    "In this notebook, we tackle the problem of joint splitting and unsupervised denoising, which has a use case in the field of fluorescence microscopy. From a technical perspective, given a noisy image $x$, the goal is to predict two images $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $x = c_1 + c_2 + n$, where $n$ is the noise in $x$. In other words, we have a superimposed image $x$ and we want to predict the denoised estimates of the constituent images $c_1$ and $c_2$. It is important to note that the network is trained with noisy data and the denoising is done in a unsupervised manner.\n",
