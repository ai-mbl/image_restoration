    "In this notebook, we tackle the problem of joint splitting and unsupervised denoising, which has a use case in the field of fluorescence microscopy. From a technical perspective, given a noisy image $x$, the goal is to predict two images $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $x = c_1 + c_2 + n$, where $n$ is the noise in $x$. In other words, we have a superimposed image $x$ and we want to predict the denoised estimates of the constituent images $c_1$ and $c_2$. It is important to note that the network is trained with noisy data and the denoising is done in a unsupervised manner.\n",

This architecture, given an input patch, enables the generation of multiple outputs. Technically, this happens by sampling multiple different *latent vectors* in the latent space. In mathematical terms we say that \"*<nobr>Micro$\\mathbb{S}$plit</nobr> is learning a full posterior of possible solutions*\".\n",

    "This is a cool feature that makes our variational models pretty powerful and handy!!! Indeed, averaging multiple samples (predictions) generally allows to get smoother, more consistent predictions (in other terms, it somehow averages out potential \"hallucinations\" of the network). Moreover, by computing the pixel-wise standard deviation over multiple samples (predictions) we can obtain a preliminary estimate of the (data) uncertainty in the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this framework, the parameter `mmse_count` (int) determines the number of samples (predictions) generated for any given input patch. A larger value allows to get smoother predictions, also limiting recurring issues such as *tiling artefacts*. However, it obviously increases the time and cost of the computation. Generally, a value of >5 is enough to get decently smooth predicted frames. For reference, in our papers we often use values of 50 to get the best results. "

    "# **Exercise 2**: Evaluating MicroSplit performance\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have trained MicroSplit and had a first qualitative evaluation on the validation set. However, at this point of the course you should be familiar with the idea that a proper evaluation should be carried out on a held-out test set, which has not been seen by the model during any part of the training process. In this section we perform the evaluation on the test set, which will include a further qualitative inspection of predicted images and a quantitative evaluation using adequate metrics to measure models' performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for this task, on a standard GPU, we cannot feed the entire image to <nobr>Micro$\\mathbb{S}$plit</nobr>. Hence, we process smaller chunks of the full image that we so far called **patches**. Usually, at training time these patches are obtained as random crops from the full input images, as random cropping works as a kind of ***data augmentation*** technique. However, at test time we want our predictions to be done on the full images. Hence, we need a more \"organized\" strategy to obtain the patches. An option is to divide the full frames into an ordered grid of patches. In our paper, we call this process ***tiling*** and we call the single crops ***tiles***, to differentiate them from the ones we use for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent issue in ***tiled prediction*** is the possible presence of the so-called ***tiling artefacts***, which originate from inconsistencies and mismatches at the borders of neighboring tiles (see (c) - No padding in the figure below). This problem can be alleviated by performing ***padding*** of the input tile, and later discarding the padded area when stitching the predictions. The idea here is to introduce some overlap between neighboring tiles to have a smoother transition between them. Common padding strategies are:\n",
    "- ***Outer padding***: the patch (tile) size used for training (e.g., `(64, 64)`) is padded to a larger size. Then, the padded are is discarded during stitching.\n",
    "- ***Inner padding***: the patch (tile) size used for training (e.g., `(64, 64)`) is used as input for prediction. Then, only the inner part of it is kept during stitiching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work we use ***Inner padding*** as it preserves the same field of view the network has seen during training and empirically provides better performance on our task (see (b)).\n",
    "\n",
